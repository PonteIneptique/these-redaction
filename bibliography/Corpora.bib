	title = {Creating a {Parallel} {Treebank} of the {Old} {Indo}-{European} {BibleTranslations}},
	abstract = {In this paper, we report on the creation of a syntactic annota tion scheme to be used in a comparative study of the oldest ext ant versions of the New Testament in Indo-European languages: the Greek ori ginal, as well as the translations into Latin, Gothic, Armen ian and Church Slavonic. The tag set was created in a pilot study involving s yntactic annotation of the Gospel of Mark in Greek and Latin. The resulting tag set is well suited for capturing syntactic variation bet ween these languages, particularly in areas having to do wit h pragmatics and information structure – as the treebank is created within a l arger project in this field – but also more general syntactic d ifferences.},
