	abstract = {Electronic texts have been used for research and teaching in the 
humanities ever since the end of the 1940s. This paper charts the 
development of various applications in literary computing including 
concordances, text retrieval, stylistic studies, scholarly editing, and 
metrical analyses. Many electronic texts now exist as a by-product of 
these activities. Efforts to use these texts for new applications led to 
the need for a common encoding scheme, which has now been developed 
in the form of the Text Encoding Initiative's implementation of the 
Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), and to the need for 
commonly used procedures for documenting electronic texts, which are 
just beginning to emerge. The need to separate data from software is 
now better understood, and the variety of CD-ROM-based text and 
software packages currently available is posing significant problems 
of support for libraries as well as delivering only partial solutions to 
many scholarly requirements. Attention is now turning to research 
towards more advanced network-based delivery mechanisms.},

Initially targeted for mainframe storage and retrieval, the data is now also being published and distributed on CD-ROM for use with microcomputers. Two such projects, the TLG Project at the University of California-Trvine and the Isocrates Project at Brown University's IRIS Center are described as well as other CD-ROM projects for the storage and dissemination of literature in the humanities and classical research. Various CD-ROM systems are also described, including the Ibycus Scholarly Computer.},
